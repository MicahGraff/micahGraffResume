				<h2>2016—2021  •  Bachelor of Computer Science and Mathematics  •  University of Idaho  •  Moscow, ID</h2>
				<h3>I am going into my third year of five at the University of Idaho. I am dual majoring in Computer Science, with a focus in Video Game Development, and Mathematics, with a focus in Computational Theories. Additionally, I am minoring in Physics. Outside of class I use the programming knowledge I have to make projects for fun, or for friends.</h3>

				<h3>For my Junior and Senior years of high school I joined the Running Start program, which let me finish graduating high school while simultaneously starting college.

				<h3>During the summer of 2015 I joined a class at General Assembly that was all about Front End Web Development. This is where I learned the majority of my Front End skillset, as this class taught us to build a website from scratch through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</h3>

 				<h1>ACTIVITIES & INTERESTS</h1>
				<h3>In my free time I continue to play many video games - which was what led me to Computer Science in the first place - for fun, and to get better ideas for myself if I continue into the video game field. I have also joined a Fraternity in college which has allowed me to develop many friendships, and has made me become an even more social person.</h3>
