				<p>I was born and raised in the Seattle area in a close-knit family. Having two older brothers and a father who was in the tech field led me to get into video games. Whether watching or playing, I learned about most games every time one came out. Eventually though, playing the games wasn't enough for me, and I started to get into how they were made. From there I took every computer science class I could, and even changed schools to be able to take more. Now I am in college at the University of Idaho majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics.</p>

				<p>I was twelve when I first started playing around with programming. I made a Minecraft server and hosted it so all my friends could play with me. I loved it, and continued to learn through online courses. Once I was in high school I took the only coding class my small school offered, and so the next year I transferred to a bigger school to take their AP Computer Science classes. Then I transferred again the next year to Bellevue College - through Running Start - to get into college level CS courses.</p>

				<p>Currently I am going into my Junior year at the University of Idaho majoring in Computer Science, with a focus in Video Game Development, Mathematics, with a focus in Computational Theories, and minoring in Physics. I am loving my studies and the enviornment in general, and am excited to start off my career as a developer wherever and whenever I am able!</p>
